# Predictive Analysis & Visualization: Stack Overflow Survey 2023

## Introduction

In this project, we conducted predictive analysis and visualization on the Stack Overflow Survey 2023 dataset, which encompasses responses from over 90,000 developers. Our goal was to identify key trends and patterns within this vast dataset, predict developer salaries accurately, and effectively communicate our insights through data visualization.

## Key Achievements

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - We employed exploratory data analysis techniques to delve into the Stack Overflow Survey 2023 dataset. This process allowed us to uncover valuable insights, trends, and patterns within the developer community. By exploring the data, we gained a deeper understanding of the survey respondents, their demographics, and their professional preferences.

2. **Predictive Modeling with CatBoost:**
   - To predict developer salaries, we applied the CatBoost regression model. This machine learning model achieved an impressive R-squared (RÂ²) value of 0.82. Our model's ability to predict developer salaries within $5,000 of the true values demonstrates its accuracy and reliability. This insight can be invaluable for both job seekers and employers in the tech industry.

3. **Effective Data Visualization with Tableau:**
   - Visualization is a powerful tool for conveying complex data-driven insights. We utilized Tableau to create compelling and informative visualizations that articulate the trends and patterns we discovered during the EDA process. These visualizations make it easier for stakeholders and the broader community to grasp the survey results.

## Project Details

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- We conducted a comprehensive exploration of the Stack Overflow Survey 2023 dataset, focusing on demographic information, developer roles, programming languages, and job satisfaction.
- Through this analysis, we identified trends related to the most popular programming languages, developer job satisfaction, and salary distribution across different countries and experience levels.

### Predictive Modeling with CatBoost

- We implemented the CatBoost regression model to predict developer salaries based on various features, such as years of experience, education level, and job role.
- The model's high R-squared value (0.82) indicates its proficiency in estimating developer salaries with a high degree of accuracy.

### Data Visualization with Tableau

- We harnessed the power of Tableau to create visually engaging charts, graphs, and dashboards.
- Our visualizations effectively communicate the insights derived from the extensive Stack Overflow survey dataset, making it easier for stakeholders and the community to interpret and act upon the findings.

## Conclusion

This project's combination of exploratory data analysis, predictive modeling, and data visualization provides a comprehensive understanding of the developer community as revealed in the Stack Overflow Survey 2023. By applying the CatBoost regression model, we can predict developer salaries with impressive accuracy. Furthermore, our visualizations enable us to communicate complex insights in a clear and accessible manner.

Our work can be beneficial for job seekers, employers, and tech industry enthusiasts seeking to make informed decisions based on the trends and patterns within the developer community. This project showcases the potential of data-driven analysis and machine learning to uncover valuable insights and make predictions that impact a wide range of stakeholders.
